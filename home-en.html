				Hello, I am Marina - a speech therapist
				<p>from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I graduated from University of
					Gercen with a speech therapy degree in 1985. I have been doing what
					I love for over 20 years, including 5 years in Chicago.</p>
				<p>Amongst my patients, there are children with delayed speech
					development, improper pronunciation of various sounds and
					psychological disorders.</p>

			<div class="media-body">
				<p>If by the age of 3 your child does not speak, or speaks in
					such a way that it is hard to understand, then it is recommended to
					visit a qualified speech therapist.</p>
				<p>In order to receive a free consultation you could contact us
					by phone, skype, email or simply by submitting a request on this
					website.</p>
				<p>The consultation allows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>to determine whether your childâ€™s speech is sufficiently
						developed according to their age</li>
					<li>to understand the nature of speech imperfections</li>
					<li>to find out what kind of exercises are needed</li>
					<li>to agree on a good time and mediums of therapy</li>
				</ul>
